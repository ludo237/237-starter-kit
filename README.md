# Custom Laravel Starter Kit

## Introduction

This React starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

It's a fork from the original [Laravel React Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/react-starter-kit) with more opinionated defaults such as
stricter `pint.json`, `phpstan.neon` settings, Docker structure with custom images as well as useful bin scripts folder.

The rest is similar to the original kit, so it has React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com)
component libraries.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for all Laravel starter kits can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits). It should be enough even for this kit

## License

This starter kit uses the same MIT license of the original one.
